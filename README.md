# Jean-O-Type ðŸ“ˆðŸ‘–

From the 1950s to today, jeans have remained a timeless symbol of style and self-expression in pop culture. In this project, we explore the world of denim, analyzing how different styles of jeans have trended across decades.

We built a TensorFlow-based image classifier to help users identify and learn about various types of jeans from their own wardrobes. To visualize fashion trends over time, we used Plotly to create interactive line charts showcasing the popularity of jean styles through the years. To tie these together we built a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit and Framer.

Whether you're a fashion enthusiast or just curious about your closet, our tool brings the history of denim to your fingertips!
